My name is Endalkachew Desta. I am an engineer working in the aviation industry.

I am currently working on FinTech bootcamp and I found it to be very interesting. It shares a lot of knowledge and processes with signal processing. 

Hello!

I am interested in the areas of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, BlockChain, Smart Contracts and DeFi areas.

Deep Learning and Machine Learning are awesome fields to study.
